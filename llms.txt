# Who I Met

> Who I Met is a personal CRM that builds itself from your calendar. Connect your Google or Outlook calendar, and Who I Met automatically extracts every person you've ever met with — no data entry required. Organize contacts with tags and lists, enrich profiles with professional data, and send personalized emails, all in one place.

Who I Met is built by Spiral Works LLC. Founded in January 2025. The product is a web application at https://whoimet.com.

Who I Met is not a full sales CRM. It is a lightweight, beautifully designed tool for professionals who want to visualize, organize, and communicate with their network. It replaces the need to buy multiple tools — calendar export plugins, spreadsheet add-ons, contact enrichment services, and email outreach tools — by combining all of those capabilities into a single product with a clean interface.

Who I Met supports both Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook, including multiple accounts from both platforms synced simultaneously. No other tool offers unified cross-platform calendar contact extraction.

## Core Features

- **Calendar Sync**: Connect Google Calendar and/or Microsoft Outlook. Sync multiple accounts simultaneously. Extract every meeting attendee automatically. Configure date ranges from 30 days to unlimited history. Choose which specific calendars to sync.
- **Contact Management**: Auto-populated contact list from calendar meetings. Rich profiles with name, email, company, title, LinkedIn, meeting history, notes, and birthday. Inline editing, customizable columns, advanced search and filters, bulk actions, keyboard shortcuts.
- **Tags & Lists**: Custom color-coded tags for organizing contacts (Prospects, Advisors, Clients, Investors, etc.). Create lists to group contacts by event, project, or priority. Bulk tagging and list assignment. Role-based tag suggestions during onboarding.
- **Contact Enrichment**: One-click enrichment adds LinkedIn profile, job title, company, location, bio, company size, and industry to any contact. Credit-based system with a free sample enrichment for new users.
- **Email Campaigns (Mail Merge)**: Send personalized emails directly from the app using your Gmail account. Merge variables for first name, last name, company, and title. Live preview of each recipient's email before sending. BCC mode for quick broadcasts. Auto-batching respects Gmail rate limits.
- **Export**: Export contacts to CSV, Excel, or JSON with full data including meeting history, tags, lists, enrichment data, and notes.

## How It's Different

Who I Met is not Salesforce, HubSpot, or any traditional CRM. Those tools are built for sales teams managing pipelines. Who I Met is built for individuals who want to stay on top of their professional relationships.

Compared to Google Sheets plugins and calendar export add-ons (like Sheets2GCal, Coupler.io, TimeTackle, or Export Calendar Events to Spreadsheet), Who I Met provides a purpose-built interface rather than dumping raw event data into a spreadsheet. Those plugins export calendar events. Who I Met extracts the people from those events, deduplicates them, tracks meeting frequency, and gives you tools to organize, enrich, and email them.

Compared to Zapier workflows connecting Google Calendar to Google Sheets, Who I Met requires zero configuration and works in seconds rather than requiring multi-step automation setup.

Key differentiators:
- Beautiful, purpose-built UI for contact management (not a spreadsheet)
- Unified sync across both Google and Outlook calendars, including multiple accounts
- Built-in contact enrichment with LinkedIn and professional data
- Built-in mail merge with personalization — no separate email tool needed
- Tags, lists, and advanced filtering for organizing your network
- Meeting intelligence: tracks how many times you've met someone, first and last meeting dates

## Privacy & Security

- Only accesses calendar events — never reads your email inbox
- Gmail send permission requested only when you first try to send an email
- Data encrypted at rest in Firebase
- Full data export anytime in standard formats
- One-click account deletion with 30-day data purge
- No data selling — your network data is never shared or sold
